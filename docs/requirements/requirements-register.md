# Requirements register

Every requirement the product owes, given a stable ID, traced back to its PRD section and forward
to the sprint that delivers it. Sprint documents cite these IDs; nothing gets built that is not on
this list, and nothing on this list is left without a sprint.

Mirrored in both repositories — update both in the same change.

**Legend.** Owner: `BE` backend, `FE` frontend, `BOTH` a contract across the seam.
Status: `DONE`, `PLANNED`, `DEFERRED` (explicitly out of v1).

## 1. Business rules (BR)

The invariants the product exists to enforce. Every one of them is enforced **server-side**; the
UI mirrors them for the trader's benefit but is never the thing that applies them. A rule that only
the browser enforces is a rule a `curl` command ignores.

| ID | Rule | PRD | Owner | Sprint | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BR-01 | The instrument, real dates and macro context of an active session are never disclosed before an explicit reveal | §1.2, §3.1 | BE | 02 | PLANNED |
| BR-02 | The replay cursor is server-authoritative; a client cannot obtain a bar past it | §3.1 | BE | 03 | PLANNED |
| BR-03 | No entry order is accepted without a hard stop loss | §3.3 | BE | 04 | PLANNED |
| BR-04 | An order below the account's minimum R:R is rejected, never silently resized | §3.3 | BE | 04 | PLANNED |
| BR-05 | Breaching the account's max daily drawdown halts trading for the session | §3.3 | BE | 04 | PLANNED |
| BR-06 | A reset never overwrites or deletes history; it seals the iteration and forks a child | §3.5 | BE | 01 | DONE |
| BR-07 | Sealed iterations are read-only and provable via a hash chain | §3.5, §6.3 | BE | 01 | DONE |
| BR-08 | A session may be revealed exactly once, and only after it is closed | §3.4 | BE | 05 | PLANNED |
| BR-09 | A rejected order is recorded, not discarded — the discipline index needs the attempts | §3.4 | BE | 04 | PLANNED |
| BR-10 | Replay is deterministic: same feed and seed produce identical fills | §6.3 | BE | 03 | PLANNED |
| BR-11 | Exactly one live iteration per account tree, and one open session per account | §3.5 | BE | 01 / 03 | 01 DONE |

## 5. Deferred from v1

Recorded rather than dropped, each with the reason:

| ID | Requirement | Why deferred |
|---|---|---|
| FR-AUTH-08 | Unauthenticated sandbox mode | Needs an abuse and rate-limiting story before an unauthenticated endpoint can create sessions |
| — | Prop Firm Challenge Simulator (PRD §7 Phase 3) | Depends on the whole gate and analytics stack; the risk policy on `accounts` is already shaped for it |
| — | Trader Edge Sharing Cards (PRD §7 Phase 4) | Depends on the reveal being complete; sharing a pre-reveal card would leak the answer |
